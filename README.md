# ProTeGen

An educational **Swift [Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) Book** for *iOS* that demonstrates a simple implementation of **Pro**cedural **Te**rrain **Gen**eration, using a small 2D world, made primarily with *SpriteKit*. 

Using this method, it's possible to make games or scenes with virtually inifinite dimensions and variation. In this case, we start small, but these concepts are much the same even in worlds much larger, more complex, or with three dimensions.

Work through activities demonstrating how to define rules that will generate countless unique worlds, based on simple conditions. 

## Purpose
This activity was created as a submission to the [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) 2018 Scholarships Program. It is maintained as an ongoing effort to share enthusiasm and educate others, in an attempt to demystify Procedural Generation.

## Contents
Broken into five distinct activity pages, **ProTeGen** works through:

* **Introduction:** initial representation of the world
* **Variety:** non-uniformity in the terrain
* **Features:** generating features based on position or certain conditions
* **Details:** generating features based on other features
* **Beyond:** ideas for future activities
