# ProTeGen

We're going to look at a simple implementation of **Pro**cedural **Te**rrain **Gen**eration, using a small 2D world made with **SpriteKit**. Using this method, it's possible to make games or scenes with virtually inifinite dimensions and variation. In this case, we start small, but these concepts are much the same even in worlds much larger, more complex, or with three dimensions.

Work through activities demonstrating how to define rules that will generate virtually infinite unique worlds, based on simple conditions.
