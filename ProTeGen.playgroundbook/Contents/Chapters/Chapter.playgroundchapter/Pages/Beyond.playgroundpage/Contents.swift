//: ## Extras: beyond what we've done
//: This has been a quick look at a very simple implementation of procedural generation, but there are many ways it could be built on. **Some ideas to explore could be:**
//: * make new types of **Block**s with textures of your own. This could start with some similar to those we have, such as a frozen grass block, and go from there. Clouds might be a fun challenge, let's get you started:
let cloud = Block(color: #colorLiteral(red: 1, green: 1, blue: 1, alpha: 1), collision: .background, opacity: .transparent)
//: * make new **BlockCategory** sets, such as a new set of leaves (what was done to randomly placing fruit on trees on the previous page) or "nearWater".
//: * make **Block**s with clever purposes
//:
//: **Some things that could be experimented with in your own implementation of a system like this could be:**
//: * add particle effects. This could be used for things such as making it snow if the world is a snowy biome, or have a random chance of raining in the jungle.
//: * add objects into the scene. An easy way to do this would be instead of using textures as sprites in SceneKit, we could instead draw emojis as sprites. This would enable blocks such as üå±üåªüíé‚ù£Ô∏èüêõ to be used.
//: * turn it into an infinite runner game, by adding simple input that would move the character sprite and generate new columns for the world on the fly.
//: * investigate ways that more resource-intensive systems implement procedural generation, with the addition of noise functions instead of individual random selectors, or data structures that have better inbuilt knowledge of adjacency instead of our simple array, such as k-d trees.
